The iOS chat application project is designed using the MVVM architectural pattern,
which allows for better separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the data layer.

Once logged in, users can view all other users of the application and start chatting with them.
The app allows users to send both text messages and photos to other users. Users can select photos from their device's photo library.
The photos are then uploaded to Firestore, and a link to the photo is sent in the chat message.

The chat application is built using Swift and follows the MVVM design pattern.
Firestore is used to manage the user authentication, real-time database, and file storage.

Overall, the iOS chat application project provides a simple and efficient way for users to stay connected with other users of the application by enabling them to send text messages and photos in real-time.
